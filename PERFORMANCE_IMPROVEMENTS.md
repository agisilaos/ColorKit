# ColorKit Performance Improvements

## Version 1.4.0 Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in ColorKit version 1.4.0 to improve efficiency and reduce computational overhead.

### Caching Mechanism

A new `ColorCache` class has been introduced to cache expensive color calculations. This singleton class provides thread-safe caching for various color operations:

- **LAB and HSL Color Components**: Caches the results of color space conversions to avoid redundant calculations
- **WCAG Luminance and Contrast Ratios**: Stores previously calculated accessibility values
- **Blended Colors**: Caches the results of color blending operations
- **Interpolated Colors**: Stores gradient interpolation results

### Optimized Operations

The following operations have been optimized with caching:

1. **Color Space Conversions**
   - LAB color conversion now checks the cache before performing calculations
   - HSL color conversion uses caching to avoid redundant transformations

2. **WCAG Calculations**
   - Relative luminance calculations are cached
   - Contrast ratio calculations between color pairs are cached

3. **Color Blending**
   - Blended colors are cached based on the source colors and blend mode
   - Early return for alpha=0 cases to avoid unnecessary calculations

4. **Gradient Generation**
   - Color interpolation now uses caching for better performance
   - Interpolation in different color spaces (RGB, HSL, LAB) benefits from caching

### Implementation Details

- The cache uses color component values as keys for efficient lookup
- For performance reasons, interpolation values are rounded to 3 decimal places
- Thread-safe implementation using `NSCache`
- Available on iOS 14.0+ and macOS 11.0+

### Usage

The caching mechanism is automatically used by ColorKit methods. No changes to your code are required to benefit from these performance improvements.

```swift
// Example: First call calculates and caches
let lab1 = color1.labComponents()

// Second call retrieves from cache (much faster)
let lab1Again = color1.labComponents()
```

### Manual Cache Management

If needed, you can manually clear the cache:

```swift
// Clear all caches
ColorCache.shared.clearAllCaches()

// Or clear specific caches
ColorCache.shared.clearBlendedColorCache()
ColorCache.shared.clearInterpolatedColorCache()
```

### Performance Impact

These optimizations significantly improve performance in scenarios where:

- The same colors are processed multiple times
- Multiple color conversions are performed in sequence
- Complex UI with many color calculations (gradients, blending, accessibility checks)
- Animations that repeatedly use the same color operations
